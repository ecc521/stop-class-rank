//Obtained by downloading list of schools in NC as Zipped Excel file from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/
//The output file actually contained 1 line of HTML per row, which was copied into an html file.

//It was then processed with the following code:

// let rows = document.querySelector("tbody").children
// rows = Array.from(rows)
// rows = rows.slice(6)
// let schools = rows.map((row) => {
//     return row.children[6].innerHTML
// })


//TODO: It may be better to put Wake County schools first.
